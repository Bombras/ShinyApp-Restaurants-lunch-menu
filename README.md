ShinyApp Restaurants lunch menu

Near our offices are 3 favourite restaurants where we use to go for a lunch. I was bored to check menus of each restaurant so I created ShinyApp which parse restaurans web pages and display the menus more lucid on one page. The menus summary is here https://tomas-smarda.shinyapps.io/jidelnicek/

The code is not frequently maintained so it can happen that ShinyApp crashes :(
